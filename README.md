## ü§î What is CrewSurf?

CrewSurf lets you talk to AI helpers without leaving your coding tool. It's like having a team of smart assistants that you can chat with while you code!

## ‚ú® Cool Things It Can Do

- üí¨ **Chat With AI Helpers**: Ask questions and get help without switching windows
- üß† **AI Remembers Your Code**: The AI can look at your code and understand it
- üåé **Reduced API Dependency**: Uses local AI models through Ollama - no expensive API credits needed!
- ü§ù **Team of Experts**: Different AI helpers with different skills work together
- üîß **Easy Setup**: Simple steps to get everything running
- üíª **Advanced Architecture**: Support for [sophisticated agent teams](docs/ADVANCED_ARCHITECTURE.md) with specialized roles

## üöÄ Getting Started (Super Easy!)

### Step 1: Install Stuff You Need

1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (the program that runs everything)
2. Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download) (runs AI on your computer)
3. Install CrewSurf:
   ```
   pip install crewsurf
   ```

> **Using Conda?** If you prefer conda environments, check out our [Conda Integration Guide](docs/CONDA_INTEGRATION.md) for running CrewSurf with conda!

### Step 2: Start Your AI Team

Just run this command:
```
python -m crewsurf.start_team
```

### Step 3: Start Talking!

When the program is running, just type your questions or ideas when asked!
